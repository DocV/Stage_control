Stage engine single-threaded implementation
=======

Stage is an experiment in creating a small, proof-of-concept game engine using actor-based parallelization. Stage Control is an alternative single-threaded implementation. Stage Control was created so that the performance of Stage could be benchmarked against an engine with identical scope and features that featured no parallelization. Since the engine was created for a master's thesis written at a Finnish university, all of the code comments are currently in Finnish (sorry, non-Finns!).
